		<p>Narendra Damodardas Modi born on 17 September 1950, is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi.</p>
		<h2>What I like about our PM</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Indian Culture: <br>Before 2014, India's culture was known only for peoples in our country.After PM Modi came to power, he told the western world what really is the Indian culture.<br><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6244cfdb25e421bcf9bae43577a84b44-lq"></li>
			<li>Strong Stand Against Terrorism:<br>Till 2014, whenever any terrorist attack took place in India, the Congressd Government used to postpone cricket matches with Pakistan. They didn't knew what the people of India want. But after PM Modi came to power, he gave a befitting reply to terrorism.<br><img src="https://i.insider.com/580384118d83b460078b48fb?width=1200&format=jpeg"></li>
			<li>Anti-Corruption:<br> The people became literally tired after hearing one after another corruption and scam cases. After 2014, nothing such took place. Even though the demonetization was not much successful, still the people supported it, as the intentions were right.<br><img src="https://scontent.fblr4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/186510291_318503969715650_8961364672409993206_n.png?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=TnZeni_lpbgAX86Wp2I&_nc_ht=scontent.fblr4-1.fna&oh=00_AfB7IcTKiKUsUzLDiob5NXDmjYKfAzi1X8jQkhaduBXB-g&oe=64575EF5"></li>
